A brief explanation behind the image search.

The SolrWayback web application comes with a simple frontend where you can test
the image search feature.



Worklow:
A search text is passed to Solr and return a list of documents:
doc1
doc2
...
docn

For each document:
 * If it is an HTML page, load it from the arc-file(on disk) and parse the HTML to find
   images. For each image find the image-document is solr (temporally near) and collect these image documents.
 * If the document already is an image just add it to the collection (and no need to read the arc/warc file)
 
Since the images have a hash we only collect the same image once.
Now return a list of ArcFileEntries (for the images) to the frontend.
The front-end renders all the images by getting the image from the servlet with arcfile and offset as
queryparams(and scale parameters). The servlet reads the image binaries from the arc/warc and scale the image and return it.

=== Visualized: <br>
So from the original resultset from solr, we generate a list of images for each document <br>
doc1 <br>
   image1 <br>
   image2 <br>
   ...<br>
doc2<br>
   image1<br>
   image2<br>
   ...<br>
doc3<br>
    image1  (if it is an image there is also only one)      <br>
...<br>
docn:<br>
    image1<br>
    ...<br>
<br>
The method now returns all the images meta data (ArcEntryDescriptor) that has file+offset<br>

The frontend can now load all the images using the REST API that loads the binary from
the arc/warc-files.
